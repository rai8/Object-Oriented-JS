Encapsulation- we are able to group related variables and functions together thus reducing complexity and increase reusability
Abstraction- hide the details and complexity of the program thus reducing complexity and impact of change
INheritence- allows us eliminate redundant code
Polymorphism - allows us to refactor ugly code such as switch statements 
object- is a collectionof key value pairs
method- this is a function inside an object, and is used to define some logic
property - this is fundamentally used to hold values
we have three ways of creatinng an object- object literals, factory function and constructor function
Every object always has a constructor property in it
To note: in javascript functions are objects
value types in javascript- numbers, strings, boolean, symbol, undefined, null(Are defined as primitives)
Reference types- objects, functions and arrays (Are defined as objects)
object in javascript are dynamic, thus we can add more properties, delete other value proprties, modify 
We can either use the bracket or dot notation to access property- if we have special characters then its valid to use the  bracket notation
ie. 'center-location'- to access this we use the bracket notation 
to delete we use the delete property
